for event in File:
    Get # of particles 
    Get trigger info
    if 4 particles and passes trigger:
        Get info for each photon (pt, eta, phi, mvaID)
        Store photon 4-vectors
        Apply necessary cuts                                                #Just need to apply Vetos, otherwise good
        Find all combinations of pairs of pairs (1234, 1324, 1423)          #Literally just combinations, cannot be wrong 
        Apply combinations to make diphoton objects                         #Just applied line 24 to 22 -> looks good
        Choose and apply pairing method (dR, MA)                            #Only lines that could give issue are 24-26 -> looks good
        Fill Histogram with variable of choice                              #No physics just filling what we did
